## Why is Mental health Important?
Mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, affect people’s ability to participate in health-promoting behaviors. In turn, problems with physical health, such as chronic diseases, can have a serious impact on mental health and decrease a person’s ability to participate in treatment and recovery. Mental health conditions will affect a staggering one in four people at some time in their lives. When it comes to our commitments to the rest of the world, people are silent on the issue of mental health.


## Mental Health in 2020
### What the Statistics say
1/4 population is affected by a mental or neurological disorder. 50% of lifetime mental illness begins by the age 14, 75% by 24. 5% of adults experience a mental illness equivalent to 43.8 million people. And this is just a fraction of it.
